        <h2>5:What is lazy loading in react?</h2>
        <p>lazy loading means that a component or a part of code must get loaded when it is required. It is also referred to as code splitting and data fetching . Talking about React specifically, it bundles the complete code and deploys all of it at the same time.</p>
        <p>Example:An example of image lazy-loading can be found on the popular publishing platform Medium, which loads lightweight placeholder images at page load, and replaces them with lazily-loaded images as they're scrolled into the viewport.</p>

        <h2>6:Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component?</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Stateless Component</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A stateless component is independent of its state.</li>
                <li>A stateless component renders the props.</li>
                <li>In stateless component,props are displayed like props.name</li>
                <li>It renders the output depending upon the props value.</li>
                <li>A functional components are always a stateless component.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Stateful components</h3>
            <ul className='items'>
                <li>A statelful component is dependent of its state.</li>
                <li>A stateful component can renders both states & props.</li>
                <li>In stateful component,states & props are displayed like this.props.name</li>
                <li>It renders the output depending upon the state value.</li>
                <li>A class components are always a stateful component.</li>  
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>7:How do you switch one component to another & using Conditional Rendering?</h2>
